    Our leading question is twofold. We want to determine the correlation between a Twitch user's account language and the number of views they get. From there, we  want to determine how many connections it takes to connect a twitch user who speaks a specific language to a twitch user who does not speak that language.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Linkage and Location

Our data could be the basis of a campaign to provide real-time translation to Twitch accounts that speak foreign languages in order to provide more interconnectivity across cultural/language barriers. This analytics tool will be used to visualize platform language disparities on Twitch. If we find that a specific language corresponds to a higher view count, this data can be used to lobby for stronger real-time translations for languages that have lesser viewer counts. This conclusion of this project has the potential to increase viewership for minorities facing a language barrier, spur career growth, and promote ideals of equality on Twitch.
