<h3 align="center">Twitch Gamers and their Social Networks</h3>

  <p align="center">
    Our leading question is twofold. We want to determine the correlation between a Twitch user's account language and the number of views they get. From there, we  want to determine how many connections it takes to connect a twitch user who speaks a specific language to a twitch user who does not speak that language.

<!-- Location of our code -->
## Location of code
* #### Major code location
  The code is broken up into seperate subsections located within their respective folders, much like the organization of our MPs was.

  Under the [cs225](#heading-1 "Goto heading-1") folder, under [make](#heading-1 "Goto heading-1") we have our Make file for the project saved as [cs225.mk](#heading-1 "Goto heading-1").

  Under the [src](#heading-1 "Goto heading-1") folder, we have six files primarily related to our algortithm implementation, our graph implemtations, and the node class. 
    * The [algorithm.cpp](#heading-1 "Goto heading-1") and [algorithm.h](#heading-1 "Goto heading-1")   

  



  
  
* #### Data location
  Under the [data](#heading-1 "Goto heading-1") folder, we have the [README.txt](#heading-1 "Goto heading-1") that contains a summary of our data. 
    * For the location of the actual data, click [here](http://snap.stanford.edu/data/twitch_gamers.html) for the website we used for the database. After you are on the page, navgiate down to the Files section and download the [twitch_gamers.zip][large_twitch_edges.csv](#heading-1 "Goto heading-1") file. Then, go to the [data](#heading-1 "Goto heading-1") folder and create a new folder called [real_data][large_twitch_edges.csv](#heading-1 "Goto heading-1").  Now open up the downloaded zip file and move the [large_twitch_edges.csv](#heading-1 "Goto heading-1") and the [large_twitch_features.csv](#heading-1 "Goto heading-1") into the [real_data](#heading-1 "Goto heading-1") folder and save them as seperate CSV files.
