####**Team Contract          snmehta2-athev2-dhanker2-farazms2**

##Communication 
1. **Team Meetings:** Our team will meet Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and Sunday in the mornings from 11am-1pm. We will meet in person at 707 S 4th Street. There will not be a designated note taker since we will be meeting often enough where progress can be monitored by seeing progress in code. Should there be a time where people cannot meet, we will have Meeting Minutes to catch the other person up. 

2. **Assistance:** Each team member will need to check their @illinois.edu email address, as well as messaging from phone numbers on a daily basis as updates will be coming frequently. We will be calling using phone numbers, which we have already exchanged, and email larger updates via email.

3. **Respect:** Since we are going to be meeting four times a week, we will designate a “group lead” everyday that will lead the discussion and go over any updates or necessary changes. Each person will be in charge of the program management for the day and go over the week’s progress and then delegate tasks to each group member for the next time they meet. Since each day will have a different lead, their voice and leadership style will be heard and taken into account. The group will have a different leader everyday, and they will be able to voice and assign tasks to the rest of the group members. This means that everyday a new person’s voice will be heard and their ideas will be implemented. . 
##Collaboration 
1. **Work Distribution:** We will assign workload for this project using the four different aspects of the project. Each member will be able to contribute to everyone else’s aspect of the project, but will not be the deciding factor on executive decisions with regard to those subsections. Data processing and collection will be specialized by someone as the lead of this aspect of the project. The graph and algorithm implementation will be two fold, split into creation of the 2 graph data algorithms. Each person would head the implementation of one of the graphs, and get input from everyone else on how to code it. The last person will serve as the overarching helper of the group. Since the project is collaborative but headed by various members, whoever says that they need help will call upon the fourth person specifically to assist them. These borders and titles are very lenient and are just designed to give the project some structure. The code will be worked on by each member of the team at all times, just led loosely by one of us at a time. For unforeseen circumstances, we will meet as a group through Zoom whenever we see that the circumstances have risen. This emergency meeting will address what has happened, how it affects the project, and how we can curtail this issue in the future. 
	

2. **Time Commitment:** To ensure an equal distribution of work, each member is expected to independently work no less than two and no more than six hours per week on the project. If a deliverable ends up taking more time, the rest of the team should be pulled in to assist with the unforeseen complication, with each member taking an equal share of the workload or programming in pairs. It is the team’s responsibility, not the individual’s responsibility, to make sure a weekly deliverable is finished by the end of the week. 
However if a team member is habitually not completing their tasks, they may be asked – politely – to explain their circumstances. Based on their explanation further actions, such as alerting a staff member, may be taken on a case by case basis decided by the other team members. 
As long as the deliverables for the week are covered by each team member, the amount of time spent each week can vary.

3. **Conflict Resolution:** To resolve disagreements, we will sit down with the other members not involved and pitch our ideas to them, as well as reservations we had about the other one’s ideas. Once we have both ideas pitched, we will go through positive and negative ideas in both and then create a holistic solution. If people have not completed tasks, they will be repeatedly reminded on social media, as well as email. If someone is late, we will wait for 5 minutes after the start of the meeting for them to come, otherwise we will continue the meeting and phone them in and fill them in on any updates.
