## Development Document
**Monday, 11/14 - Friday, 11/19**
This week, we took on the task of pre-project research. We dove into our dataset, and deliberated on how to analyze our data. We decided that we would be creating a Node struct, and will be populating member variables for each feature that the node has. From there, we will create our graph using an adjacency list. This is becuase, based on our initial skim through our dataset, our graph will be sparse, and will not require the optimizations that are associated with an adjacency matrix and dense graphs. This graph will hold our dataset in a traversable format. We were going to start developing this week, but we were confused on how to get the project started with a C++ environment. We will either make a clone of one of the MPs, or we will go to office hours to see how other groups are approaching this problem.
